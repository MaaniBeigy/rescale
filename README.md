:straight_ruler: Generic feature scaling methods

[Feature scaling](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling>) is a method used to normalize the range of variables or *features* of data. In data processing, it is also known as *data normalization* and is usually performed during the *data preprocessing* step.

# Getting started

If you are using Linux or macOS, you need to install **Rust** using [rustup](<https://rustup.rs/>):

```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

For installation on Windows, read the instruction in [rust-lang book](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows>).
